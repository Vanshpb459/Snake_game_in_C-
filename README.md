# Snake_game_in_C++
This C++ project implements a classic Snake game using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The game allows a player to control a snake that moves around a grid, consuming food pellets and growing in length. The game ends when the snake collides with itself. Using Classes, Structure, and other concepts I learned many things including new libraies too.
